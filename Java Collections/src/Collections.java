 * Collections are a set of Interfaces and Classes that allow users to 
 * leverage the various data structures that are available.
 * 
 * Collection Framework:
 * This framework allows users to store and manipulate data within various
 * data structures
 * 
 * For more information visit: https://www.javatpoint.com/collections-in-java
 * 
 * Interface vs classes:
 * The difference between class and interface is that: An interface contains a bunch of methods 
 * and variables, but they are all abstract. Meaning, an interface contains only the signature 
 * of the method but not the body
